# Traffic-Sign-Classification

Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

The **German Traffic Sign Benchmark** is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge. This Data contains around 51k images of traffic sign distributed under 43 categories.
The dataset has the following properties:

- Single-image, multi-class classification problem
- More than 40 classes
- More than 50,000 images in total
- Large, lifelike database

It is a project that stretched my understanding of Neural Networks especially CNNâ€™s and their successful use in Computer Vision. I built the network on Keras framework running on top of Tensorflow backend, trained on Kaggle platform using thousands of images in the training set and attained an accuracy of 96.7% against the test set. I further tested the model on some independent external data and it performed well.
